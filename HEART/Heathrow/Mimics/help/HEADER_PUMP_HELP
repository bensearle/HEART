-------------------------

This control option changes the appearance of the object background colour, this is used to highlight a Transfer of Service, the colours are as follows:

Start Pump

----------

As the pump is in Remote Control permanently the appropiate control option is presented to the user. Start Pump will send a start control to the PLC. (It is only possible to switch on any one header pump at any time, therefore the control options for start and stop are only presented to the appropiate pump.)


Stop Pump

---------

As the pump is in Remote Control permanently the appropiate control option is presented to the user. Stop Pump will send a stop control to the PLC.


NB, Only the appropiate controls are contained in the Menus, i.e. it is only possible to stop the pump if the pump is running.
