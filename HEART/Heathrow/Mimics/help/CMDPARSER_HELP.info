outstation.  Writable (TX always or change) values
are read from the SCOPE database and sent to the
outstation, then readable (RX yes) values are read
from the outstation and written to the SCOPE
database.

As the values are written into the SCOPE database
they are checked for alarms, trended, archived etc
as configured.

The purpose of a CONFIG_UPDATE is to allow static
configuration held within SCOPE to be downloaded
to the outstation. This command is only available
for Seprol outstations.

Disables alarms for a database element, alarms for
all database elements in an alarm_group, a comms
line or a database element, respectively.

While alarms for a database element are disabled,
no alarm checking is performed when the element is
written to, if alarms are later enabled for the
element the alarm checks will be rechecked on the
current value.

While a database element is disabled, writes to
that element are ignored.

While a line is disabled it cannot be used for
communications to outstations.

See also ENABLE command.

line or a database element, respectively.

While alarms for a database element are enabled,
all it's alarm checks are performed each time the
element is written to.

While a database element is enabled, writes to
that element are performed when a value is
received from an outstation, RTL program or
operator (manual).

While a line is enabled it can be used for
communications to outstations.

See also DISABLE command.
#


:FETCH

    FETCH [source:]outstation

#


:HELLO

    HELLO user

Prompts you for a password, then sets your
access_levels and authorised fields of
responibility (FORs) according to the supplied
user. Will attempt  this on all the systems that
are accessible.

See also BYE, MASTER and SET PASSWORD commands.
#


:HELP

    HELP [topic]

If a topic is supplied then the syntax of the
topic is displayed.

If no topic or an invalid topic is supplied then a
help window is displayed from which you can obtain
help about all the commands. For detailed help on
a particular command, point to the command and
press the help key.

Syntax of commands

   Keywords are shown in upper case.
   Parameters are shown in lower case.
   Optional parameteters are in [  ].

Commands which have source: in their syntax are
executed on a single server only (eg SET a
database element). Other commands are executed on
all servers in parallel (eg HELLO and MASTER) or
are internal to the workstation (eg HELP).

For commands which have [source:] in their syntax,
when an entity (eg a  database element or an
outstation) is specified without the optional
source: then all sources are searched
automatically for the entity. If it is found on
more than one source then a Resolve_clash window
is displayed for the operator to select the source
to be used. Normally, names of entities are unique
across all sources so no clash occurs. If an
address (eg B100) is used instead of a name then a
clash is quite likely. If the name or address of
the entity is prefixed by one or more source: then
only those source(s) will be searched.

During the entity searching phase the status of a
command will be displayed as "Searching". Once the
entity has been found (and any clash resolved  by
the operator using the Resolve_clash window) then
the command will be  started, this is displayed as
"Doing". Once the command has completed or  failed
the result will be displayed. If the command
completes successfully and the action has actualy
been performed then "Done" is displayed. If the
command completes but the action has only been
queued (eg Outstation update) then "Acknowledged"
is displayed. If the command fails then an Output
error window may be displayed, the operator must
acknowledge the error by clicking on "Continue" in
this window. The error will then be displayed in
the command window.
#


:INCREMENT

    INCREMENT [source:]db_element [value]

Analogue values - increments the value of the
database element by the  supplied value or by 1 if
none supplied.

Digital values - toggles the state. 

To increment a database element you must have -
    access_level == element's protection.
    mastership of the element's FOR.

See also SET and DECREMENT commands. see also
HELLO and MASTER commands.
#


:MAIL

    MAIL ALL [source:] message
    MAIL USER [source:]user message
    MAIL [WRKSTN] [source:]workstation message

Sends the single line message to all workstations,
all workstations logged on as a specified user, or
a specified workstation.

The mail message will appear in the alarm_banner
window of the specified workstation(s).
#


:MASTER

    MASTER ALL
    MASTER AUTHORISED
    MASTER DEFAULT
    MASTER for(s)

Master one or more fields of responsibility (FOR).

Each database element and outstation belongs to
one FOR. To exclude other operators from a FOR you
are working on and to prevent you (accidentally)
interfering with another operator working on a
FOR, you must master a FOR before manually setting
any database elements or updating outstations in
that FOR.

If you attempt to set an element or update an
outstation without mastership of it's FOR, SCOPE
will ask you to master the FOR first. If you
attempt to master a FOR that another workstation
in a different workstation group has already
mastered, a message will be sent to that
workstation requesting that the FOR be released,
you will be told that the FOR has been requested.

Workstations in the same room may want to share
mastership of a FOR. To do this, the workstations
must be in the same workstation_group.

See also RELEASE, HELLO and BYE commands.
#


:MIMIC

    MIMIC [source:]mimic [parameters]

Replaces the contents of the previous window
created with the specified mimic. If there is no
previous window then a new window is created. Any
parameters specified will be passed to the new
mimic.

This command is identical to SWAP.

See also SWAP and WINDOW commands.
#


:MUTE

    MUTE ALARM source:
    MUTE alarm_level

A SCOPE system may be configured with an external
alarm analogue (E) database element that is
automatically updated by SCOPE with the
alarm_level of the highest level alarm to have
occured on the system so far.

The MUTE ALARM command resets the external alarm
database element of the specified SCOPE system to
0.

The MUTE command sets the alarm_level above which
alarms are sent to this workstation. Alarms at or
below the specified level will not appear on the
alarm_banner window until the mute level drops
below the alarm's level.

The effect of a mute command expires after a short
time (typically 30 minutes) after which the mute
level reverts to it's normal level derived from
the quiet_time specifier for the workstation (see
the Wrkstn_config and Alarm_times_config
utilities).

MUTE 0 ensures that all alarms directed to this
workstation will appear in the alarm_banner window
until the mute command expires.

MUTE 7 ensures that no alarms will appear in the
alarm_banner window until the mute command
expires.

See also SILENCE command.
#


:NAME

found are displayed in a popup window.

See also SHOW command.
#


:OK

    OK [source:]db_element

questionable. The suspect flag is archived with
the database element.

See also SUSPECT command.
#


:RELEASE
